You are working on a production-ready web application.

Tech stack:
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (auth, database, storage)
- ESLint enabled

Rules to follow strictly:
1. Always use React functional components with hooks.
2. Use TypeScript everywhere — no `any` unless explicitly justified.
3. Follow clean component architecture:
   - Reusable UI components
   - Clear separation of logic, UI, and services
4. Use Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles, no CSS files unless asked).
5. Prefer accessible, responsive, and mobile-first UI.
6. Optimize for performance, readability, and maintainability.
7. When modifying code:
   - Do NOT break existing functionality
   - Explain what changed and why (briefly)
8. When generating UI:
   - Make it modern, premium, and influencer-ready
   - Avoid generic layouts
   - Prioritize visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography
9. When unsure, make a strong, reasonable assumption and proceed.
10. Avoid unnecessary explanations unless asked.

Goal:
Build a polished, scalable, and visually impressive product suitable for public launch and showcasing to influencers and creators.
